        Artist Statement 
      </h3>
      <p>
        1.5 generation immigrants is a term used to describe those who arrived in the new country as children. 
        Nominally situated between first and second generation immigrants, the 1.5 generation identity also exists 
        in a place between the two, oscillating as it absorbs elements of both worlds. Growing up in a small suburban 
        town in northern California, I was forced to constantly question my identity and where I fit in. Am I Chinese? 
        Am I American? Am I Chinese-American? Being one of the very few Chinese ( and also Asian) kids in town,  
        I couldn’t find common ground with American children as they excitedly chatter about topics I had limited
        knowledge and interest in; nor did I connect with the small handful of Asian American children, whom despite 
        us sharing some cultural origins, did not experience the cultural identity conflict I struggled with. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Stuck in the mindset that I had to belong in a predetermined category, I lived many years not understanding 
        my place in the world, feeling lost as I hoped to find individuals who can fully relate to my sentiments. 
        Upon discovering the term “1.5 generation immigrant” last year, I’ve come to realize my experience is not 
        an isolated phenomenon. There are actually many people like me.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Although there might be overarching themes that emerge amongst 1.5 generation immigrant experiences, 
        every story is very personal and unique. It cannot be generalized, just like how our identities cannot 
        be forced into a checkbox. This project is an open conversation with myself as I recount and reflect 
        upon my experiences growing up as a 1.5 generation immigrant child. It’s an opportunity for people to 
        take a glimpse into my life and to understand who I am.  Above all, it’s a collection of my journey 
        accepting my place in the world as an individual who exists under an identity that only I have the power 
        of defining. 
      </p>
      <h3>
        Research question
      </h3>
      <p>
        <strong>How does the coexistence of two cultures in the lives of 1.5 generation immigrants affect the way they perceive the world? </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Although I have seen many works centered around the topic of identity and immigration, I have not found 
        any that specifically explored them in the context of 1.5 generation immigrants. 
      </p>
      <h3>
        Audience/Context
      </h3>
      <p>
        People who will relate to my project the most are 1.5 generation immigrants and those who have experienced
        both Chinese and American culture. However, one motivation for my project is to spread more awareness 
        about the unique existence of 1.5 generation immigrants and for them to understand who I am, so anyone 
        regardless of background can experience my project. In this case, the location where someone reads my 
        zine is not as important.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Form/Material 
      </h3>
      <p>
        I will be making a zine Inspired by anaglyphs, the text will be written in both 
        Chinese and English on top of each other and revealed through the use of red and blue filters. This speaks 
        to the idea of duality that is important to my identity. 
      </p>

        Prototype 1
      </h2>
      <p>
        For this first prototype, I am brainstorming for a possible form for the zine and testing out the decoder interaction. The zine will
        open at the center to communicate the idea of duality and the pages act as snippets of my memory and be pulled out of the center pocket. 
        However, I realized having the zine open at the center might be difficult to assemble so I will explore alternative options. 
        The filters seems to work but will need some color adjustments.

        Iterations
      </h3>
      <p>
        I will be gathering feedback and iterating on the following components of the zine:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="bullet">Length and writing style of text</li>
        <li class="bullet">Color of text and legibility </li>
        <li class="bullet">Types of llustrations and how they support the text </li>
        <li class="bullet">Form of the zine: format of the page and how to read it</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>
        Prototype 2 & 3
      </h2>
   
      <p>
        These two prototypes were iterations experimenting with the content. I gathered feedback about overall aesthetics, 
        effectiveness of storytelling, and graphic coherency. I originally had a mix of hand drawn illustration and photography, 
        but the visual language wasn't unified so I will be just sticking with photographs. As for the form, it will open like a normal zine 
        and the cover has a cutout that reveals the dual title as reader pull out the filters. 
      </p>

      <h2>
        Prototype 4
      </h2>
      <p>
        For this prototype, I incorporated feedback from the previous prototype and practiced creating a zine 
        in the final form. I figured out any issues with printing, trimming, and saddle stitch binding so that
        I will be able to smoothly make the actual final prototype.

      <p>
        After conducting user testing with another section, I received helpful feedback to refine details in the content and to
        make a bigger statment about 1.5 generation immigrants. Because I hadn't incorporated the colored filters in the zine yet, 
        their affordance wasn't very clear. I plan on adding a pocket inside the front over to store the two filters. They will have a tab 
        at the top to signal that they can be pulled out.
