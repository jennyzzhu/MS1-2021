        Day 1

        <strong>How can the zine reading experience be more immersive?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       A comment I received from the external crits during midterm review suggested that a collection 
        of dual experiences could be compelling. The first idea that popped into my head was a zine. 
        But how can I incorporate a digital component into this experience? For this prototype, I tested 
        out what it’d be like to scan QR codes as someone flips through the pages. 
      </p>
      <div class="fullwidth">
        <img src="https://cdn.glitch.me/40af8fdd-c98b-469c-b407-95da8eb38039%2FIMG_6529.jpg?v=1635914824671v">

      <p>
       This interaction is successful at expanding upon the traditional zine reading experience. 
        However, it can become boring and redundant as time goes on. Some additional considerations: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="bullet">How can the interaction be more varied and fun? 
        </li>
        <li class="bullet">Taking inspiration from pop up books, maybe each page can open up to a 3D component that supports different interactions. 
        </li>
        <li class="bullet">Expanding upon the QR codes, What will the immersive component be like if they led to supplementary audio or videos? 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        Day 2
      </h3>
      <p>
        <strong>How can I portray duality with visual elements? </strong> 
        
      </p>
      <p>
        A peer asked me in the midterm feedback if there are certain color or typography 
        that speaks to the 1.5 gen experience, and so I attempted to use visual language to communicate these elements. 
      </p>
      <div class="fullwidth">
        <img src="https://cdn.glitch.me/40af8fdd-c98b-469c-b407-95da8eb38039%2F7%20in%207%20Prototype%202%20actual%20-01.jpg?v=1635918377337">
      </div>
      <p>
        This piece takes the first character of China (中国) and America (美国) as the centerpiece as explores topography and symmetry. 
      </p>
      <div class="fullwidth">
        <img src="https://cdn.glitch.me/40af8fdd-c98b-469c-b407-95da8eb38039%2F7%20in%207%20Prototype%202%20actual%202%20-02.jpg?v=1635919421135">
      </div>
      <p>
        This second piece is about color and spatial relationships. The two main rectangles are inspired by the Chinese and American flag and 
        red, the color they have in common, is used to represent the "in-between." The stripes are taken from the American flag and 
        creates an optical illusion to represent confusion and fluidity. 
      </p>
      <h3>
        Day 3
      </h3>
      <p>
        <strong>How can I display a collection of experiences beyond the form of a zine? </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        While pondering this question, the pensieve from Harry Potter randomly came to mind. For those who are not familiar, it’s a shallow bowl 
        filled with liquid-like silver strands that each represent a memory. People can immerse themselves in those memories as if it’s happening 
        before their eyes. 
      </p>
      <div class="fullwidth">
        <img src="https://cdn.glitch.me/40af8fdd-c98b-469c-b407-95da8eb38039%2FPensieve%20.jpeg?v=1636006197699">
      </div>
      <p>
        So I thought, “hmm a device that holds my experiences (or memories) could be an interesting take.” My mind then led me 
        to a gumball machine. What if each experience is held inside a capsule? 
      </p>
      <div class="fullwidth">
        <img src="https://cdn.glitch.me/40af8fdd-c98b-469c-b407-95da8eb38039%2FUntitled_Artwork%209.jpg?v=1636006326116">
        <img src="https://cdn.glitch.me/40af8fdd-c98b-469c-b407-95da8eb38039%2FIMG_6563.JPG?v=1636006209942">

      </div>
      <p>
        I would write memories or experiences that represent my duality on a piece of paper, put them in color-coded capsules, 
        then tossed inside a device. The different color capsules could also act as a data visualization of my experiences. People 
        interact with it by taking a capsule and reading about a piece of my identity. 
      </p>
      <p>
        After creating the simple paper prototype, I realized it resembles a tissue box, perhaps in part due to the material used. 
        While I don’t think the shape of a box is successful, the concept has a lot of potential to be developed. Components to consider: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="bullet"><strong>Form: </strong>What shapes can the device be to better represent duality? Can there be more compartments inside? 
</li>
        <li class="bullet"><strong>Audience interaction:</strong> What are fun ways people can take out the capsules? How can this process be more intentional? 
          What emotions do I want to elicit? Can I invite others to add their own story to this collection? </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>
        Day 4
      </h3>
      <p>
        <strong>How can 1.5 gen immigrants find a community of similar individuals?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       An insight I gathered from my personal experience and from my research is that it’s difficult for 1.5 gen immigrants 
        to fit in due to their mix of cultural experiences. They have a hard time connecting to people and when they do, 
        it’s usually with other 1.5 gen like them. This led me to to brainstorm for an social app that highlights people’s 
        cultural backgrounds, in hopes of creating a community where 1.5 generation immigrants can feel a sense of belonging. 
 
      </p>
      <p>
        The concept for this app is similar to Bumble bff, a platform for building friendships. The main difference is that
        it highlights people’s cultural heritage and background as the point of connection. They can add friends and chat with them 
        on the app, with an ultimate goal of further connecting offline.

      <p>
        This idea is a very practical and functional approach for tackling my research question. Building a good app requires thorough 
        UX research, design, and testing. If I were to proceed with this idea, I will need to conduct more focused interviews with 1.5 gen 
        immigrants and user tests between each iteration. The time constraint will be a big limitation. 
      </p>
      <h3>
        Day 5
      </h3>
      <p>
        <strong>How can 1.5 generation immigrants feel more connected with their identity? </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of trying to connect with others, the focus can be on connecting with themselves by acknowledging and understanding the in-between space. 
        Some people from my interviews are very accepting of their identity, and thus the question is, how did they overcome the obstacle to arrive at this state 
        of mind? I think that true acceptance cannot come from external validation but instead is based on internal I decided to make cards with a set of questions that are targeted at self-reflection and self-appreciation.

        A solo card game can become boring so the rules will need to be thoroughly designed. Some questions that came to mind:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="bullet">What are the rules of this game? Can it also be multiplayer? </li>
        <li class="bullet">What visual elements can be incorporated into the design of the cards? Perhaps incorporate the prototype of day 2? </li>
         <li class="bullet">The container that holds these cards should also be thoughtfully designed. What will the form be  and how does it connect to the contents? 
</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        Day 6
      </h3>
      <p>
        <strong>How can 1.5 gen immigrants connect with others through play? </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        This prototype is an attempt to answer a question from yesterday’s reflection about the nature of a card game. 
        What would a multiplayer game be like? I created a board game inspired by the ones I played as a child in Mario Party 8. 
        Both players start on their side of the board and the goal is to be the first to reach the center. Players would roll a dice
        to move and if they land on a colored square, they have to take a card from the corresponding pile and answer the question 
        ( same cards as yesterday’s prototype). 
      </p>

      </div>
      <p>
        This prototype made me realize how complex designing a board game can be. Not only does it have to be fun, 
        but it should also be scalable and clearly communicate the core theme or goal. This idea would be challenging 
        but also fun because it incorporates components of several previous prototypes. I can experiment with material, 
        design graphics of the board and the cards, and apply UX skills to the play experience. A big concern is not having 
        enough time to iterate each component. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Some considerations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="bullet">How can it be further scaled to a 3+ player game? What would that dynamic and conversation be like? </li>
        <li class="bullet">How long is the game intended to be? </li>
    
      </ul>
      <h3>
        Day 7
      </h3>
      <p>
        <strong> How can my experience be expressed through graphic design? </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Inspired by Xu Bing’s work about language and books, I created a zine spread to combine the zine idea from Day 1 and the visual elements from Day 2. 
        A big component of being a 1.5 gen immigrant is the integration and fluidity of both 
        languages. The featured text are phrases others have said to me while growing up that are representative of my 
        experience. The phrase on the left is most commonly used in disbelief when people find out I had a knowledge gap 
        about something that is “quintessentially American.” The text is written vertically and read from left to right to mimic traditional Chinese text format. 
        The phrase on the right means “Can you understand” and is used
        when people question my ability to comprehend Chinese. The gradual fading is portraying how I've learned to ignore these comments.
