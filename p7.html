        Day 1
      </h3>
      <p>
       A comment I received from the external crits during midterm review suggested that a collection 
        of dual experiences could be compelling. The first idea that popped into my head was a zine. 
        But how can I incorporate a digital component into this experience? For this prototype, I tested 
        out what it’d be like to scan QR codes as someone flips through the pages. 
      </p>

        This interaction is sucessful at expanding upon the traditional zine reading experience. It might be 
        worth exploring what the immersive componet will be like if the QR codes led to supplementary audio or videos.

      <h3>
        Day 2
      </h3>
      <p>
        A peer asked me in the midterm feedback if there are certain color or typography 
        that speaks to the 1.5 gen experience. Therefore today's focus is on visual elements. <strong>How can I portray 
        duality with graphic design? </strong> 
      </p>
      <div class="fullwidth">
        <img src="https://cdn.glitch.me/40af8fdd-c98b-469c-b407-95da8eb38039%2F7%20in%207%20Prototype%202%20actual%20-01.jpg?v=1635918377337">

        This piece takes the first character of China (中国) and America (美国) as the centerpiece as explores topography and symmetry. 
      </p>
      <div class="fullwidth">
        <img src="https://cdn.glitch.me/40af8fdd-c98b-469c-b407-95da8eb38039%2F7%20in%207%20Prototype%202%20actual%202%20-02.jpg?v=1635919421135">
      </div>
      <p>
        This second piece is about color and spatial relationships. The two main rectangles are inspired by the Chinese and American flag and 
        red, the color they have in common, is used to represent the "in-between." The stripes are taken from the American flag and 
        creates an optical illusion to represent confusion and fluidity.
