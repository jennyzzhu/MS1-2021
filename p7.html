        Day 1
      </h3>
      <p>
       A comment I received from the external crits during midterm review suggested that a collection 
        of dual experiences could be compelling. The first idea that popped into my head was a zine. 
        But how can I incorporate a digital component into this experience? For this prototype, I tested 
        out what it’d be like to scan QR codes as someone flips through the pages. 
      </p>
      <div class="fullwidth">
        <img src="https://cdn.glitch.me/40af8fdd-c98b-469c-b407-95da8eb38039%2FIMG_6529.jpg?v=1635914824671v">
        <img src="https://cdn.glitch.me/40af8fdd-c98b-469c-b407-95da8eb38039%2FIMG_6531.jpg?v=1635914831870">

       This interaction is successful at expanding upon the traditional zine reading experience. 
        However, it can become boring and redundant as time goes on. Some additional considerations: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="bullet">How can the interaction be more varied and fun? 
        </li>
        <li class="bullet">Taking inspiration from pop up books, maybe each page can open up to a 3D component that supports different interactions. 
        </li>
        <li class="bullet">Expanding upon the QR codes, What will the immersive component be like if they led to supplementary audio or videos? 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        Day 2
      </h3>
      <p>
        A peer asked me in the midterm feedback if there are certain color or typography 
        that speaks to the 1.5 gen experience. Therefore today's focus is on visual elements. <strong>How can I portray 
        duality with graphic design? </strong> 
      </p>
      <div class="fullwidth">
        <img src="https://cdn.glitch.me/40af8fdd-c98b-469c-b407-95da8eb38039%2F7%20in%207%20Prototype%202%20actual%20-01.jpg?v=1635918377337">
      </div>
      <p>
        This piece takes the first character of China (中国) and America (美国) as the centerpiece as explores topography and symmetry. 
      </p>
      <div class="fullwidth">
        <img src="https://cdn.glitch.me/40af8fdd-c98b-469c-b407-95da8eb38039%2F7%20in%207%20Prototype%202%20actual%202%20-02.jpg?v=1635919421135">
      </div>
      <p>
        This second piece is about color and spatial relationships. The two main rectangles are inspired by the Chinese and American flag and 
        red, the color they have in common, is used to represent the "in-between." The stripes are taken from the American flag and 
        creates an optical illusion to represent confusion and fluidity. 
      </p>
      <h3>
        Day 3
      </h3>
      <p>
        <strong>How can I display a collection of experiences beyond the form of a zine? </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        While pondering this question, the pensieve from Harry Potter randomly came to mind. For those who are not familiar, it’s a shallow bowl 
        filled with liquid-like silver strands that each represent a memory. People can immerse themselves in those memories as if it’s happening 
        before their eyes. 
      </p>
      <div class="fullwidth">
        <img src="https://cdn.glitch.me/40af8fdd-c98b-469c-b407-95da8eb38039%2FPensieve%20.jpeg?v=1636006197699">
      </div>
      <p>
        So I thought, “hmm a device that holds my experiences (or memories) could be an interesting take.” My mind then led me 
        to a gumball machine. What if each experience is held inside a capsule? 
      </p>
      <div class="fullwidth">
        <img src="https://cdn.glitch.me/40af8fdd-c98b-469c-b407-95da8eb38039%2FUntitled_Artwork%209.jpg?v=1636006326116">
        <img src="https://cdn.glitch.me/40af8fdd-c98b-469c-b407-95da8eb38039%2FIMG_6563.JPG?v=1636006209942">
        <img src="https://cdn.glitch.me/40af8fdd-c98b-469c-b407-95da8eb38039%2FIMG_6567.JPG?v=1636006227569">
      </div>
      <p>
        I would write memories or experiences that represent my duality on a piece of paper, put them in color-coded capsules, 
        then tossed inside a device. The different color capsules could also act as a data visualization of my experiences. People 
        interact with it by taking a capsule and reading about a piece of my identity. 
      </p>
      <p>
        After creating the simple paper prototype, I realized it resembles a tissue box, perhaps in part due to the material used. 
        While I don’t think the shape of a box is successful, the concept has a lot of potential to be developed. Components to consider: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="bullet"><strong>Form: </strong>What shapes can the device be to better represent duality? Can there be more compartments inside? 
</li>
        <li class="bullet"><strong>Audience interaction:</strong> What are fun ways people can take out the capsules? How can this process be more intentional? 
          What emotions do I want to elicit? Can I invite others to add their own story to this collection? </li>
      </ul>
