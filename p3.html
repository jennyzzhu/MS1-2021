        After taking in the feedback from the last critique, we decided to juxtapose a historical photo on its current location. There will be colored 
        transparent layers that can be slid either up/down or side to side, arrow tabs on the color layers, foot prints in front of the intervention, and 
        a tripod stand to provide stability and possible rotation affordance.

        We first took a historical photo taken at Bethesda Fountain and used an AI program to add some color.

        Using Photoshop, we then split the image into its CMYK channels so that it can be overlayed on top of one another to create an image. These 
        CMYK layers were printed on transparent film paper and glued onto 1/16" transparent acrylic sheets.

        Reflections 
      </h3>
      <p>
       We were quite worried about the level of interaction this intervention would get because there were a lot of conceptul and phsyical 
        changes from the first prototype. Despite have a good outcome, I still feel that it's difficult to get people to interact with a foreign object. 
        There were potential for more interactions with people passing by who were curious enough to look at it but didn't linger around, and this made me think
        about how to close this gap and how to get longer interactions.
      </p>
    <p>
      <strong>A few possible reasons:</strong>
      </p>
     <ul>
       <li class="bullet">There wasn't enough discoverability. Those who were passing by could see what the image looked like without stopping.
       </li>
       <li class="bullet">There wasn't enough reward. There wasn't enough depth to the interaction after playing around with the filter. </li>
       <li class="bullet">The height of the tripod stand wasn't friendly towards kids.</li> 
        <li class="bullet">The tripod wasn't approachable. The black color wasn't inviting and gave off the impressiont that it might be someone's personal project 
       that people shouldn't touch</li>
       <li class="bullet">The Historical context wasn't clear enough. Without using text, it was hard to communicate the historical significance and 
       intention of this intervention.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        While we were setting up, someone came up and asked whether the project was a camera. This was an interesting assumption and made me think 
        about the physical form of the project. If there was a future iteration, it'd be interesting to try to build a very simple camera contraption 
        that allows people to capture a simple image.
