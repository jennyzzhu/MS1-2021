        This project was completed by my friend as a part of a project at keio University's School of Media Design. 
        It explored the alternative third person pronoun in Chinese 
        as a provocation and an investigation into the inherently non-binary nature of Chinese."By encouraging people 
        who natively read Chinese characters to deeper question their formation, and the implications it has for
        Chinese / Japanese societies, it hopes to reveal a flexibility and playfulness built into one of the worlds oldest 
        languages. Binary gender pronouns came into existence in Chinese after the introduction of the female pronoun, which, 
        in a stark contrast to the West, fueled a gendered conciousness and an empowerment of women within China. 祂 and 㐴 
        (visually similar to "TA", netspeak for gender neutral 他) are presented as new pronouns to highlight the inherent 
        gender fluidity within the Chinese writing system."

        "1000 most common Chinese words were written in random order, which are supposed not to make any sense. The installation is activated by a 
        translation app. Based on camera capture and image recognition, the machine translation provides a real-time "non-sense" "poem"."

        Topic of Interest

      <p>
        As someone who was born in China and then immigrated to the United States at a young age, I feel equal presence of both cultures in my life. 
        Drawing upon my own experiences, I'm interested in investigating the 1.5 generation immigrant(someone who immigrated at a young age) experience.
