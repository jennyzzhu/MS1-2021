        Topic of Interest

      <p>
        As someone who was born in China and then immigrated to the United States at a young age, I feel equal presence of both cultures in my life. 
        Drawing upon my own experiences, I'm interested in investigating the 1.5 generation immigrant(someone who immigrated at a young age) experience.

        <strong>Book From the Sky:</strong> Xu Bing is a renowned Chinese artist known for his work investigating how language, text, and words have 
        affected the way we perceive the world. One of his most famous works is a large-scale installation consisting of 4,000 pseudo characters
        displayed on hand-printed books and ceiling scrolls.This piece explores the relationship between written language and culture 
        by creating seemingly legible characters that actually cannot be read. Some interpreted it to be a reaction to propaganda Xu experienced 
        under Mao’s rule, in which language was abused by those in power. Others say it’s an examination into the authority of a book and how that 
        changes as meaning is separated from written form.

        <strong>Crying in H Mart:</strong> This a memoir that was first published as an essay in The New Yorker and has since been expanded 
        into a book due to its popularity [Figure 4].After losing her mother to cancer, the author reflects upon their relationship through memories of her 
        childhood growing up as half Korean and half white. She explores her identity and sense of self through the lens of food, a medium she connected with 
        her mother and Korean side most prominently. The title alludes to her experience inside the Korean grocery store, H Mart, a place where she most often 
        misses her mother.

         This is a very emotional piece filled with honesty, endurance, vulnerability and also strength. The author reflects deeply about both sides of her 
        identity in a very personal way and she has inspired me to examine my life in a similar manner.

        <strong>Mahjong Tiles:</strong> This project by Valerie Lam is a celebration and exploration of her identity as a Chinese-American. She uses Mahjong, 
        a traditional Chinese tile game, as a medium of communication with her family to overcome their language barrier. The Mahjong tiles she created have 
        a question on each one that is aimed at gaining a deeper understanding of her culture and family history [Figure 3]. An example question is: what was 
        it like living in China in your time?

        <strong>Oriental Groceries</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Stephanie H. Shih is a ceramic artist who explores the Asian American identity through the creation of grocery items made from clay. A series
        titled Oriental Groceries highlights the intimacy and importance behind groceries commonly found in Asian households, such as Chapagetti instant 
        noodles, Chinkiang black vinegar, Lee Kum Kee oyster sauce, and Lao Gan Ma chili oil. Not only are these pieces classified as art,
        they are also artifacts that signify snapshots of Asian American culture through a mixture of both traditional and non-traditional flavor profiles. 
        This project has similarities with Crying in H Mart as they both explore identity through food, an essential aspect of culture.

        Ask/Interview
      </h3>
      <p>
        I interviewed two friends who are 1.5 generation immigrants to learn more about how they view their identity. The questions I asked are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li class="bullet">How do you define your cultural identity?</li>
        <li class="bullet">How did your cultural identity shape your values and beliefs?</li>
        <li class="bullet">How do you relate to the languages you speak?</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I then sorted some of their responses into an affinity diagram. Three themes that emerged are <strong>cultural fluidity, duality, and understanding. </strong>
