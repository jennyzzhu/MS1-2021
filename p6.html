        Midterm Reflection
      </h1>
      <p>
       The midterm presentation feedback was very helpful and raised many thoughtful questions for me to think through. 
        One big question both my peers and external crits brought up is who is my target audience. While reading through 
        the peer feedback, I realized people who are not defined as 1.5 gen immigrants can also relate to the feeling of 
        “in-betweenness” I described. However, does experiencing the duality of culture first hand versus through their 
        parents lead to the same perspective? My initial reaction is not quite. The unique perspective of 1.5 gen immigrants 
        comes from having lived in both countries at a young age when their sense of identity is molding. 
 
      </p>
      <p>
        My early childhood years had no imprints of American culture. I spoke Chinese 24 hours a day, sang the Chinese national 
        anthem in school, and memorized ancient Chinese poems. I didn’t even know the English alphabet when I first immigrated 
        to the United States. Adapting to a sudden change in environment and culture is a major factor affecting how I think, 
        behave, and view the world today. Although everyone’s experiences can differ, I believe total immersion in their country 
        of origin would create a much stronger sense of identity than experiencing it second-hand at home. 
      </p>
      <p>
        However, I also acknowledge that defining my target audience as 1.5 gen immigrants is limiting the population by a legal 
        status and not by shared experiences. I have Chinese-American friends who were born in the US and then attended international 
        school in China, a scenario that aligns with the cultural duality I’ve experienced. Would I abandon the concept of 1.5 gen immigrants 
        if I include them? 
      </p>
      <p>
       Another consideration is whether to limit the two cultures to just Chinese and American or expand the scope to anyone who has had dual
        experiences. Most designers I’ve seen explore identity through the lens of Asian Americans who are trying to be more in touch with their 
        origin. That’s why I initially was interested in the 1.5 gen immigrant experiences because the distinction brings a whole new perspective.  
        Reading the feedback, the amount of positive response and curiosity about this topic is nudging me to hold on to this term.  
      </p>
      <p>
      A peer asked what creates a sense of belonging for me. A major obstacle I had growing up was connecting with people. I feel belonging 
        when people who share similar experiences understand my viewpoints and relate to my struggles. I realized friends I feel the closest
        to are 1.5 gen immigrants like me. It feels liberating when people can not only sympathize but also empathize with me, and this is the feeling 
        I want to invoke by connecting people through my project. 
      </p>
      <p>
       Another peer brought up an interesting point that could people who sit in this in-between space be a whole identity in itself? I think absolutely. 
        We don’t have to choose from a list of identities that society has pre-constructed. Maybe my project can help build a community and identity 
        amongst those who sit in the “in between.” 
      </p>
      <p>
       Moving forward with my research, I can revisit Chinatown or go to Flushing and observe a certain activity such as grocery shopping, as suggested by a 
        peer. I can also visit other cultural hubs within NYC to understand how they have adapted into the space. Continuing with peer interviews, I can 
        conduct more in-depth conversations with 1.5 gen immigrants from cultures other than my own to understand how they grapple with their identity.  
      </p>
      <p>
       Since my project is about duality, it’s important to incorporate elements from both Chinese and American cultures into the core 
        interaction and aesthetic. A peer brought up an interesting point of asking if there are any colors or typefaces I gravitate towards 
        or connect to the experience of 1.5 gen immigrants. I’m very drawn to vintage Chinese and mid-century American graphic designs because they 
        trigger a sense of nostalgia and longing for the time-past. It’d be interesting to combine the aesthetic to create both a sense of juxtaposition 
        and harmony. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking about how my research can manifest into a project, I brainstormed several ideas of form: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="bullet">An interactive social game about the 1.5 gen immigrant experience. Or a series of mini-games 
          with cultural influences like in Squid Game. 
        </li>
        <li class="bullet">A book of dual experiences written in both Chinese and English, inspired by Xu Bing’s work. 
          It can be intentionally nonsensical or clearly defined. </li>
         <li class="bullet">A machine that jumbles and generates dual experiences </li>
         <li class="bullet">An app that connects people based on cultural experiences </li>
         <li class="bullet"> Reimagining childhood toys or foods with both cultural influences </li>
      </ul>
