        Location
      </h3>

      <p>
       The Bethesda Fountain is located at the Mid-Park at 72nd Street. It is
        one of the largest fountains in New York. The neoclassical sculpture,
        also known as Angel of the Waters, features an eight-foot bronze angel
        who stands above four small cherubim representing health, purity,
        temperance, and peace. Many famous movies and TV series were filmed at
        the location, such as Enchanted, The Avengers, Sex and the City, and
        Doctor Who.

        History
      </h3>
  
      <p>
        The statue, Angel of the Water, was designed by Emma Stebbins and 
        dedicated in 1873 to commemorate the opening of the Croton Aqueduct 
        in 1842.  It carries a lily in one hand and the other is poised to 
        bless the water flowing down into the fountain. There is a quote on 
        the statue that references the healthing powers of the biblical pool, 
        Bethesda, which forms a connection with the fresh water that was then
        flowing through the fountain and the city.

      <strong>Day:</strong> Many people visit the fountain during the day to take photos and stroll around. We mapped the 
        circulation of people who are doing these activities, most popular photo taking locations, and

        <strong>Night:</strong> The fountain is also very lively at night. We went on a Friday night and found lot of people 
        dancing at an organized event. People who weren't participating were standing around watching or sitting around the fountain.

        During the research process, we were amazed by the richness of the history and media exposure of this site. Because many visitors come 
        to this destination to take photos, we decided to apply a filter to give them a different perspective of this spot. In this example, we used a scene 
        from “Sex and the City” that was shot at this spot and made it semi-transparent to allow both the past and present to be visible in one view.  
        The passerbys represent movement of the current world while the static figures remind us of the past.

       Tossing coins into a fountain is a traditional way of making a wish and is a common activity at this location. With this idea, we aim to 
        create a fun way for people to do this by building a Rube Goldberg machine that will help carry the coin into the fountain.
